about: '
Nick is a Professor of Microbial Genomics and Bioinformatics in the Institute
for Microbiology and Infection at the University of Birmingham, sponsored by
a seven-year MRC Fellowship in Microbial Genomics Bioinformatics. His
research explores the use of cutting-edge genomics and metagenomics approaches
to the diagnosis, treatment and surveillance of infectious disease. Nick has
so far used high-throughput sequencing to investigate outbreaks of important
Gram-negative multi-drug resistant pathogens, and recently helped establish
real-time genomic surveillance of Ebola in Guinea and Zika in Brazil. His
current work and focuses on the development and evaluation of novel molecular
biology, sequencing and bioinformatics methods to aid the interpretation of
genome and metagenome scale data generated in clinical and public health
microbiology.'
